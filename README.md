# Tango-Controls

It's a distributed control system based on tango_controls. In this repository I upload the final python file when database TANGO is running in a device, in this case the device is a PYNQ-Z2 (Xilinx).

There is a background work about how to run the database... even the installation can be difficult. A very helpful website for it is: https://tango-controls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview.html

The python file is helpful for those projects are running. It has the most important functions and classes for write and read the different values from your device.

IMPORTANT: This project is related to the Interlock And Trigger System that it is in my repository too. I decided to separate it because this is about a distributed control system, while as the other repository is about the design, code and integration of the signals in the FPGA PYNQ-Z2
